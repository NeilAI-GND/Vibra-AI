# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Simple Static Deployment

This project has been streamlined for easy Netlify deployment with a clean, static build approach.

### Quick Deploy (Drag & Drop)

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:netlify
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag the `netlify-build` folder to the deploy area
   - Your app will be live instantly!

### GitHub Integration Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clean Netlify deployment setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in your Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
