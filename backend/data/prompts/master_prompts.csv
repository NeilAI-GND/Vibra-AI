It must feel like a 90s movie, brown hair, baddie with a small flower tucked visibly into his wavy hair, and a romantic, windy environment. The person is standing against a solid wall, deep shadows and contrast drama, creating a mysterious and artistic atmosphere where the lighting is warm with the golden tones of evoking a sunset or golden hour glow. The background is minimalist and slightly textured; the expression on his face is moody, calm, yet happy and introspective."

Paris Travel,"Create an ultra-realistic night-time portrait from this photo, standing near the Arc de Triomphe at Place Charles de Gaulle in Paris. Background: The Arc de Triomphe is fully visible and brightly illuminated in the center of the frame, with deep shadows and warm street lights glowing softly in the background. The classic ‘Place Charles de Gaulle’ street sign is clearly visible on the ornate lamppost to the right side of the subject. Lighting & Color: Maintain the warm, ambient nighttime lighting with subtle yellow-orange glows from the streetlights. Capture the same soft shadows and realistic noise/grain present in the original image. Apply similar color grading – warm highlights, deep shadows, and slightly muted tones to evoke a cinematic, moody feel. Pose & Angle: The subject is facing left, head tilted upward at a ~45-degree angle, with eyes closed and a serene, introspective expression. The camera angle is slightly low and tilted upward, capturing the chest-up view in a three-quarter profile from the left side. The pose must be relaxed, with hands in jacket pockets, shoulders naturally slouched, conveying a quiet, reflective mood. Outfit: Dress the subject in a black leather jacket layered over a red textured sweater, with the lower portion of blue jeans slightly visible. Keep the outfit textures and folds consistent with real fabric physics under the lighting conditions."
